OpenVPN is the best and most recommended open-source VPN software world-wide. It is the most secure VPN option. In order to use the service one needs to download the open-source OpenVPN Client and configure the certificate bundle from the official website (http://www.vpnbook.com/freevpn). This script opens a VPN connection without neither the need to install any GUI nor to download the password from the website (which gets changed every week).
